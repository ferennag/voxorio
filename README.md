# Introduction
This repository contains a Voxel Game implementation in C. Heavily work in progress.

# Next Steps

- Implement a basic skybox
- Add at least 4-5 different block types (e.g. sand, grass, snow, dirt, etc.)
- Make sure terrain texture and mesh data is separated. Maybe use 3D textures?
- Implement occlusion culling
- Implement Chunk loading as the player moves
- Implement Chunk offloading to disk as the player moves (and reloading again)
